# Comparative-genomic
  A comparative genomic study of bacteria involves analyzing and comparing the
genetic material (genome) of different bacterial species to understand their evolutionary
relationships, genetic diversity, and functional differences. This type of study can provide
insights into the adaptation, evolution, and ecological roles of bacteria.
Comparative genomic studies on oral and gastrointestinal tract bacteria in the human
body are crucial for better understand the genetic landscape and diversity of the
organism and its role in human health and disease.

  This study compared the genomes and protein functions of a human oral microbiota species(Veillonella
parvula DSM 2008) with two closely related species from the same genus Veillonella(Veillonella rogosae,
Veillonella nakazawae), as well as two distantly related species from the same family
Veillonellaceae(Megasphaera elsdenii DSM 20460, Dialister massiliensis). The aim was to uncover
evolutionary differences and distinctive features among them.
